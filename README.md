Predicting air pollution (AQI) in Jakarta, Indonesia using machine learning based on historical air quality and weather data

## Project Proposal
### **Overview**
Air pollution is a significant issue in Jakarta, impacting public health and urban living. The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that can **predict future AQI levels** based on historical air quality and weather data. This will help in understanding air pollution trends and potentially assist in urban planning and public health measures.
